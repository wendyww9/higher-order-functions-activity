# Implement my_max, and if time allows, my_filter and my_map

WORDS = ["jumps", "laziest", "brown", "a", "quick", "fox", "the", "dog", "over"]

# Implement a custom version of max, called my_max
# Like the actual max, consider raising a ValueError if the collection is empty
# but feel free to assume you will always be given a non-empty collection.
# Otherwise, this function should behave the same as max when a key parameter is
# supplied. It should return the value from the collection which has the biggest
# comparison value as determined by calling the function passed in the key
# parameter on it. This will be very similar to the min_function_custom
# developed in the Learn reading.
def my_max(collection, key):
    pass

# Implement a custom version of filter, called my_filter
# my_filter takes a function (should_keep) which it will call on every item in
# the supplied collection. If should_keep returns a truthy value for an item,
# then the item should be included in a new list containing only those filtered
# items, which should be returned
# WARNING: notice the parameters order is reversed compared to my_max
def my_filter(should_keep, collection):
    # if you've encountered list comprehensions, this would be a
    # great place to use one
    pass

# Implement a custom version of map, called my_map
# my_map takes a function (transform) which it will call on every item in the
# supplied collection. The result of calling transform on each item will be
# added to a new list in the same order as the original items. The new list
# should be returned.
# WARNING: notice the parameters order is reversed compared to my_max
def my_map(transform, collection):
    # if you've encountered list comprehensions, this would be a
    # great place to use one
    pass
